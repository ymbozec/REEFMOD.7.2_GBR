% TO SIMULATE MORTALITY BEING DEPENDENT UPON THE STRENGTH (CATEGORY) OF HURRICANE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   HJE MODIFICATIONS   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Original hurricane probability equation (function of colony size):
%       hurricane_prob=(-3e-007*pop(x,y,c)^2)+(0.0007*pop(x,y,c))+0.0551;
%
% Rearranging into the more familiar format:
%       hurricane_prob = a(pop(x,y,c)-h)^2 + k;
% where the x and y coordinates of the vertex are the values of h and k
% respectively.
%
% Multiplying this out we get ax^2-2ahx+ah^2+k = -3e-007*x^2+0.0007*x+0.0551
% Therefore
%           a = -3e-007
%           h = 0.0007/(-2*a) = 1166.7
%           k = 0.0551-ah^2 = 0.4138

% To modify mortality based on hurricane category we modify a and k
% First make the function symmetrical (so that we can lower the curve
% without lowering the end points):
h = 1250; %Value was previously ~1167
a = -3e-007;
k_cat5 = 0.0551-a*((0.0007/(-2*a))^2); %(Uses old value for h to achieve same maximum as before)
% The above values are appropriate for category 5 hurricanes. For the other
% categories we reduce a and k based on the relative predicted impacts
% (using Madin, Zimmerman etc).
relHurrMort = [0.0461 0.1183 0.2504 0.5677 1]; %e.g. a cat 4 has 57% of the impact as a cat 5
a = a*relHurrMort(hurricaneCat);

%% MARCH 2022: k below is now predetermined before the simulation to
%% generate same mortality at given t, reef ans run
% if META.deterministic_hurricane_mortality == 1
%     
%     k = k_cat5*relHurrMort(hurricaneCat);
%     
% else
%     % NEW (Jul 2019): add Gaussian noise into the calculation of mortality)
